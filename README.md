# Enhancing Multi-Person Pose Tracking: A Robust Strategy with Pose-Weighted Re-ID Features
This paper introduces the Decoupled Heatmap Module to effectively decouple the heatmaps generated from pose estimation, obtaining valuable keypoint information. Subsequently, a new Pose Construction Module is employed to reconstruct occluded poses. For the pose tracking task, we propose a more efficient pipeline based on re-identification (re-ID) features. This pipeline leverages the Pose-embedding Attention Mechanism to assign weights to re-ID features, mitigating interference from the background. Further, distinct matching strategies are employed for active and inactive trajectories, ensuring efficient and real-time tracking performance.
